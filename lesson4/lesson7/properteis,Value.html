<div id="test">Becoming an airline pilot involves 3-5 years of training, but the time varies significantly based on the specific path taken. Initial training can be completed in 18-24 months through an integrated course, a 4-year university degree takes longer, or a Commercial Pilot License (CPL) can be achieved in about 1-2 years. Additional time is then required to accumulate flight hours, typically 1-2 years, to qualify for an Airline Transport Pilot (ATP) license. </div>
