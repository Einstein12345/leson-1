    <h1>who is a pilot</h1>

<p>A pilot is an individual trained and licensed to operate an aircraft or spacecraft. This person controls the vehicle's direction and flight, performing tasks like flight planning, pre-flight checks, and communicating with air traffic control. Pilots can operate various aircraft, including airplanes, helicopters, spacecraft, and even ships (as a harbor pilot), and must obtain specific licenses and pass medical examinations to ensure their fitness to fly</p>

<h2>years required for a pilot to go to school</h2>

<div id="test">Becoming an airline pilot involves 3-5 years of training, but the time varies significantly based on the specific path taken. Initial training can be completed in 18-24 months through an integrated course, a 4-year university degree takes longer, or a Commercial Pilot License (CPL) can be achieved in about 1-2 years. Additional time is then required to accumulate flight hours, typically 1-2 years, to qualify for an Airline Transport Pilot (ATP) license. </div>

<h3> a pilot salary pear year</h3>

<p>A pilot's annual salary varies dramatically by experience, airline, and location, with amedian salary for airline pilots in the US being around $226,600 as of 2024, while entry-level and regional airline salaries can range from about $35,000 to $120,000, and senior captains at major international airlines can earn over $400,000 or more.  </p>
