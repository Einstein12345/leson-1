        <h1>Who is Einstein</h1>

        <p>Albert Einstein wasa German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, and is considered one of the most influential scientists of the 20th century.  His work on the photoelectric effect earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921, and his famous equation,\(E=mc^{2}\), is a fundamental principle in modern physics.  His contributions, including general and special relativity, redefined our understanding of space, time, gravity, and the universe.      Theory of Relativity: Einstein developed both the special and general theories of relativity, which describe the relationship between space, time, and gravity.  Nobel Prize: He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his explanation of the photoelectric effect, a key discovery in the development of quantum theory.  Mass-Energy Equivalence: His famous equation,\(E=mc^{2}\), expresses the relationship between mass and energy, showing they are interchangeable.  Influence: His theories formed the foundation for many modern branches of physics and continue to be crucial for understanding the universe.  Life and Immigration: Born in Germany, he became a US citizen after leaving Germany due to the rise of the Nazi Party, where he lived and worked at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. </p>
